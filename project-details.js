      "projectDescription":"With Docuverus, you can help rest assured that guests and applicants are who they say they are, and that all guests are tracked, which helps safeguard your rental agents and property managers. The Docuverus app also integrates with the Docuverus online application tracking system, which features the first ever automated income calculation and verification system.<br> \
      <b>• ID Verification</b> - Docuverus scans the guest’s photo ID (driver’s license, passport, permanent resident ID or US VISA) along with an optional scan of the applicant’s face to help verify that the ID is both valid and belongs to your guest/applicant.<br>\
      <b>• Security Logs </b> - For guests visiting your property, Docuverus also logs who toured the property, when they toured, and maintains a log of guest activity. Docuverus can also capture prospect details, including lead source, desired rent, desired rental unit type, desired move-in date, and more.<br>\
      <b>• Docuverus ATS Integration </b>- The Docuverus App also integrates with the Docuverus Online Application Portal, so that all application results can be accessed right through the app and verified guests can be invited to apply with a single click.<br>\
      <b>• Automatic Income Calculation and Verification </b> - Calculating income is usually a time-consuming and manual process left to leasing staff or landlords, who often don’t know how to calculate income correctly from documents provided by applicants. Worse, most leasing staff don’t know how to spot fraudulent documents, which are on the rise and are roughly 10 times more likely than fake ID's. <br><br>\
      Docuverus also offers the first ever automated income verification system, where verified guests can be invited to upload other required documents including proof of income. Docuverus then automatically calculates applicant income and verifies the validity of the income documents using advanced machine learning algorithms.",
